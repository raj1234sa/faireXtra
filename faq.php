If a driver spends at least 25% of their commute in the advertiser’s selected “campaign zone”, they are notified that there is an opportunity to cash in on their commute.</div>

                        <p>FaireXtra campaigns are intended for specific areas only. When you are in an active campaign, the advertiser sets a campaign zone. Campaign zones are typically within 50 KM of the advertisers target city. Compensation is entirely based upon KM driven within a campaign zone. KM’s are worth different amounts based on time of day and the amount of people on the road.</p>
                        <p>
                            For lite coverage, we estimate 5000 to 10,000 per month.<br>
                            For partial coverage, we estimate 6000 to 12500 per month.<br>
                            For full coverage, we estimate 12,500 to 20,000 per month.
                        </p>
                        <p>You are totally free and clear to drive as much as you would like. However, only 25-35 KM’s of your daily commute is compensated by FaireXtra. 25 kms within the blue campaign zone and 10 kms in the red zone, per day.</p>

                        <p>To be eligible for a campaign, you need to pass a basic background check and drive a 2008 or newer; Coupe, Sedan, SUV, pick-up truck, or minivan without significant body/paint damage.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>97% of individual passenger vehicles are eligible for FaireXtra. Some vehicles are too difficult to install with a quick turn-around time.</p>
                        <p>We also do not wrap motorcycles, commercial vehicles, transit vans, or any type of motorhomes.</p>
                        <p>Before every installation/removal appointment, the installer will perform a thorough inspection to document the vehicle condition prior to the wrap application and after the wrap has been removed.</p>
                        <p>FaireXtra and our Network of Installers use only the finest vinyl films. These films are designed to be installed and removed cleanly without damage when applied to sound, OEM painted surfaces.</p>
                        <p>
                            To determine the condition of the vehicle consider these questions:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Does your car have lots of rock chips, dents, scratches, rust or paint/clear coat damage?</li>
                                <li>Has your car or portions of your car ever been in an accident and/or repainted?</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the answer is “Yes” to either question, that means your factory paint quality could be compromised. This does not mean that damage guaranteed to happen, but the odds of damage is significantly increased, and FaireXtra cannot be held liable for further damage.</p>
                        <p>We’ve also created a guide to help assess your vehicle’s condition, which will help you decide whether FaireXtra is for you.</p>
                        <p>If there is a change to the condition of your vehicle reported after the wrap is removed, FaireXtra will work with you and the installation facility to determine best course of action.</p>
